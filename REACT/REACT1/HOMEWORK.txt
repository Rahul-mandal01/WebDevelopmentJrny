Meaning of props.className:

In React, props.className refers to a property named className that is passed to a React component as part of its props object.

The className prop is a standard HTML attribute used to specify one or more CSS classes for an element. In React, you can use it to apply CSS styles to the component.

For example, if you have a React component like this:

function MyComponent(props) {
  return <div className={props.className}>Hello, world!</div>;
}


<MyComponent className="my-class" />
<div class="my-class">Hello, world!</div>


In this example, the value of props.className is "my-class", which is passed to the className attribute of the div element. This allows you to style the component using CSS rules defined for the class my-class.
